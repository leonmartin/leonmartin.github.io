user_description: As a Data Scientist with a background in symbolic knowledge representation, I specialize in complex data analyses and the development of innovative data-heavy applications. My work focuses on introducing sustainable AI and data strategies in companies, streamlining business processes, and generating value from data. I'm a firm believer in viewing ethical values as business values, taking an end-to-end approach, and recognizing the needs and perspectives of individual stakeholders.
